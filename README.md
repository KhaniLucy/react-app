#  REACT, NODE AND EXPRESS APP
React is used as the frontend of the app, and Node and Express will be the backend of the APP- they will be communicating with each other.

This app is simillar to Facebook, however, this App is based on people talking about music.


##  PREREQUISITES

 Before you being, ensure you have the following installed on your virtual machine:

- NodeJs
- Also install Node framework Express
Express is a backend Node framework used for creating API's. 
In VS Code, we can use a separate terminal (Control + backtick to open a terminal). Make sure we're in our client folder - our React app.
## Installation
React app
```bash
 npx create-react-app (name of the folder)
```
Node Framework: Express

```bash
npm install express
```
- Ensure NODE is installed in your virtual environment.

### Add Axios for API calls 
Install Axios in a client folder React application.

Then use that to make requests to our backend and start sending data from our backend to our frontend.

```bash
npm install axios
```
Then in the server terminal add cors package

```bash
npm install cors
```
